# Rusty Ray Tracing

![Final Render](images/spheres_render.png)

This is an implementation ray tracing as presented in [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), in Rust. While the math and basic structure of the program follow Shirley's book, this repository deviates where appropriate to achieve more idiomatic Rust code.
